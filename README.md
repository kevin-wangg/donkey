# Monkey Programming Language Interpreter (and compiler)

A simple interpreter (and compiler) for the Monkey programming language, built in Rust.

This project is based on the book ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/) by Thorsten Ball, adapted to Rust.

Notes about the language:
- The `return` keyword is optional, functions/block statements always evaluate to their last expression
- All statements must end with a semicolon, even if it's the last statement in a block
- The difference between closures (let foo = fun ...) and functions (def foo ...) is that functions don't capture their environment.
Recursive functions must be defined using functions and can't be defined using closures.

## Sample Programs

### 1. Factorial Calculator
```monkey
def factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);
    }
}

let result = factorial(5);
result; // 120
```

### 2. Fibonacci Sequence Generator
```monkey
def fibonacci(n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n;
    } else {
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

let fib8 = fibonacci(8);
fib8; // 21
```

### 3. Number Comparison and Conditional Logic
```monkey
let compare = fun(a, b) {
    if (a > b) {
        return a;
    } else if (a < b) {
        return b;
    } else {
        return null;
    }
};

let x = 10;
let y = 5;
let max_val = compare(x, y);
let is_equal = x == y;
let is_positive = x > 0 && y > 0;

max_val; // 10
```
